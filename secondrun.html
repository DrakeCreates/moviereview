	<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
	
	<p>Personally, I have never been a very big Star Wars fan, but I did enjoy episodes I-III more than many probably did. For the most part
	most people that I know that have gone to see the film very much enjoyed it. A few said it was ok, but overwhelmingly there is a concensus that it is a good film and worth the price of admission.</p>
	
	<h3> The Cast</h3>
	<p> while I am unfamiliar with most all of the actors that are cast in this film, I am very  happy with their choice to retain at least one original cast member, Harrison Ford. Ford's character, Han Solo</p> 
	<ul> <li>The guy</li>
	<li>that chick</li>
	<li>the old dude</li> 
	<li>etc.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Why I didn't take you to this movie</h4>
